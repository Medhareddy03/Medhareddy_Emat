    "**In Milestone 2, I had a problem with the line graph the x-axis was not showing clean years like 2020, 2021, and 2022, but it showing values like 2020, 2020.5, and 2021, 2021.5 etc. To better arrange the data, I thought about using the melt() function, but I wasn't sure if it would address the axis issueI decided to fix it in the next milestone and started thinking about adding dashboards too. In this milestone, I solved the x-axis issue by using update_layout() to manually set the tick values and labels. After fixing it, I created a line plot to show how different types of requests — Legal Process, Emergency, and Preservation — changed over time. I grouped the data by year, added markers to highlight each point clearly, and used a clean background and gridlines to make trends easier to see. My goal was to help the audience quickly spot patterns, like which request types are increasing faster or where sudden changes happened. i took reference from this link https://plotly.com/python/tick-formatting/#:~:text=80-,Tickmode%20%2D%20Array,-If%20%22array%22.**"

I chose ten countries, including the US, India, Germany, Japan, and others, rather than displaying every nation, which could be overwhelming. I decided on a heatmap since it's great for quickly identifying patterns.After that, I used a pivot_table() to organize the data into a grid with countries as rows, years as columns, and total requests as the values. This made it easy to plot in the heatmap format, where I could see at a glance which countries and years had higher or lower requests based on the color scale.This visual makes it really easy for the audience to immediately see which countries had spikes in requests, which stayed steady, and which ones suddenly dropped off. Let the audience quickly compare countries side by side over the years, and spot interesting patterns like sudden surges, consistent growth, or unexpected drops.
