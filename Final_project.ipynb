I then read the 2021 dataset using pd.read_csv() and just checked out the first few rows with df.head() to get a feel for what the data looks like. I also run the code df.isnull().sum() and df.dtypes to see if there were any missing values or data types I should know about.**"

This map provided a global view, making it easier to spot which countries had the most activity. I chose a blue color scale because it’s neutral, and visually calming. Blue helps users focus on the data without being distracted by overly bold colors like red or green. Additionally, I kept the color scale simple to avoid cluttering the map, making it clean and easy to interpret. I used hover becuase it is simple way to display additional information when users what to interact with the map. Here in the map by using hover, they can instantly see the total number of requests for that country without cluttering the map with text or labels.I want to make the audience explore how different request types are distributed globally, and easily spot patterns depending on the request type.** "

    "**At this stage, I was interested in expanding the image and provide a closer look at a few key countries. I chose ten countries, including the US, India, Germany, Japan, and others, rather than displaying every nation, which could be overwhelming. I decided on a heatmap since it's great for quickly identifying patterns.After that,I used a pivot_table() to organize the data into a grid with countries as rows, years as columns, and total requests as the values. This made it easy to plot in the heatmap format, where I could see at a glance which countries and years had higher or lower requests based on the color scale.This visual makes it really easy for the audience to immediately see which countries had spikes in requests, which stayed steady, and which ones suddenly dropped off. Let the audience quickly compare countries side by side over the years, and spot interesting patterns like sudden surges, consistent growth, or unexpected drops. For Color code 'RdYlBu_r' I took help of google.**"

    "**My driving question for this project was to explore “How have global government requests to Facebook evolved over time, and what patterns exist in terms of country activity and request types?”.I wanted to explore how the volume and type of government requests such as legal process, emergency, and preservation requests varied across countries and years, and what that might reveal about surveillance trends, policy shifts,or geopolitical events.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I’ve been closely following how often governments around the world request data from Facebook, and the differences between countries are pretty striking. In 2024, the USA made over 158.839k requests the highest globally and a 20% increase since 2020.India stood out even more to me.Its requests almost doubled in just four years,going from around 39,692k in 2020 to over 80,004k in 2024—a massive 97% jump.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brazil and Germany also showed sharp increases. Brazil’s requests grew by over 23.81k, and Germany saw an 87% rise.In contrast, countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia stayed relatively low, averaging fewer than 2,000 requests per year.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When it comes to the types of requests, legal process requests were clearly the most common.They made up about 60–65% of the total and rose from 156,267 in 2020 to 240,762 in 2024,a 56% increase.Preservation requests made up around a quarter of the total and grew by 27%. Emergency requests were fewer in number but still rose significantly, increasing by 61%.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The heatmaps and choropleth visuals made it easier to grasp the global picture, especially how much activity is centered in countries like the USA and India.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, global government data requests to Facebook jumped by 66% in just five years.But what stands out most to me is how unevenly this activity is spread. The USA and India alone account for more than half of all requests.It’s clear that governments are relying more and more on digital platforms for investigations and surveillance, but not all are doing so at the same pace.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the end, I find it both fascinating and a bit concerning. The rapid rise in requests reflects how deeply digital platforms are embedded in modern governance and law enforcement.But the big differences between countries really make me think about issues like transparency, accountability, and personal privacy. As someone who’s genuinely interested in digital rights, I believe the way we handle these growing trends won’t just impact policy it’ll play a big role in deciding how we balance safety and freedom in our increasingly online world.**"
